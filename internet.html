					<p>The Internet could be considered the greatest development of mankind since the industrial age. Truly, it is at the forefront of the information age. It has entirely changed the way society functions, but not necessarily in the bad light as portrayed by news outlets and parents around the world. Evidence shows that there is either no relationship, or a positive cumulative relationship between the intensity of sociability and internet use. That is, the more sociable a person is, the more they use the internet, and the more they use the internet, the more sociable they are online and offline.</p>
					<p>The Internet has empowered the people through the freedom to organize and express on a global platform, leading to positive networked social movements becoming commonplace. This global connectivity allows light to be shed on any atrocities committed by governments, or any oppression of a people, and can lead to global support in such situations. This support has been available in the past but since the Internet the speed of information in the past isn’t at all comparable to the speed of information at present.</p>
					<p>Global connectivity has led to a much more international community, shifting away from separation by state or country, society is working towards becoming an ‘us’ rather than being compartmentalized. Social Networks have become the chosen platforms for all kind of activities, not just personal friendships or chatting, but for marketing, e-commerce, education, cultural creativity, media and entertainment distribution, health applications, and socio-political activism.</p>
					<p>Furthermore, a study by Michael Willmott for the British Computer Society has shown that the intensity and frequency of use of the internet leads to increase in psychological indicators of personal happiness. Global data was used from 35,000 people, and the study showed that Internet use increases people’s feelings of influence, security and personal freedom. It also showed that this effect is particularly positive for lower income people and women.</p>
					<p>There is much more to mention for the credit of the Internet, such as enabling services such as the NHS and WHO to operate on the scale that they do, or for the increase in entertainment of politics due to social media politicians, but if I were to delve into every positive effect of the Internet, this article would become much too long.</p>
