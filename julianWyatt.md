Interest of Content:

Excellent -- I enjoyed reading through the content for each of the topics, those in automation, medical were the highlights for myself, however.

Consistancy and Quality of visual presentation:

Very Good -- Although the consistancy is very high between each of the 5 pages. I feel like there should be something extra to make the pages pop. For example a few images, different fonts. Some pages included lists at the start detailing certain paragraphs; personally I would have these as headings.


Quality of written presentation:

Excellent -- Not much to fault apart from the personal preference i just mentioned about headings

Validity of HTML:

Outstanding -- No errors when put through w3 validator. However a few pages have some spelling errors

Evidence of Collaboration:

Excellent -- Author statements are written about each other and in the 3rd person. The contributions are fairly balenced, ranging from 2 to 4. Last minute work: minimal styling      changes to increase consistancy.
